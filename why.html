       <h1>Why Unmask?</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="texto_extra">
        <p>Sex crimes offer a powerful example of the kind of service UNMASK looks to provide. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, nearly 300,000 sexual assaults happen in the U.S. every year, and that is only in the U.S. Almost half of those victims are under age 18. Surveys confirm that victims nearly always know their attacker. Furthermore, there remains a stigma associated with being a victim of sexual assault. UNMASK's creators believe that victims are never at fault, and they'd like to see that stigma erased. Victims are not alone anymore.</p>
         <p>Most sex crime perpetrators will never spend time in prison. They hide in the shadows, confident no one will ever know of their terrible deeds; indeed, this is why nearly every kind of crime happens – because the perpetrator believes they will never be held accountable. This is the power and importance of UNMASK – the platform provides a way to bring these criminals to light, enabling the innocent people to steer clear of them.
             
        </p>
        <p>While protection from sexual offenders is a major benefit of UNMASK, these aren't the only kinds of transgressors who can expect to be "unmasked." Cheaters, thieves, "closet" racists, sexists, corrupt officials, drug dealers, killers, fake friends, dishonest business partners or colleagues, and unfaithful husbands or wives, any wrongdoing person can be exposed by users on the anonymous UNMASK platform. In all these cases, however, the mission is to keep innocent people safe from harm. For instance, a woman might discover that an eligible bachelor is a serial cheater and wisely avoid a relationship.
