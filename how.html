        <p>Anyone can join UNMASK, Free and anonymously as the website never request any kind of personal information for registry. UNMASK will never collect or share personal information from its users. The team behind the site is firm believer in privacy and anonymity – except when that privacy protects criminals and their crimes.  Once users had sign up they can freely start to create profiles or posting about other persons they wish to "unmask." Members can use full, legal names for these profiles.</p>
         <p>In order to prevent false accusations, false blaming or bullying, we have improved 2 systems on our website:
            1. To be able to create a profile or post something is an important requirement that users also upload any hard evidence – video, audio, photos, documents, links from other social networks they have of the person's wrongdoing. 
            2. Once a profile or post is live, the user community can vote on the accuracy of material, FALSE or TRUE. Enough "False" votes will result in an automatically profile or post deletion. 
             
        </p>
        <p>Once profiles or postings are created, there is no possibility to delete or modify it. Unmask offers a free environment for users to post or write anything about any person.

        We also have improved a SEARCH engine; so once our data base becomes with many profiles stored, any user will be able to search easily any person by his legal name.
        </p>
        <p>As last, we have improved a RANK system; so any user will be able to vote from 1 to 5 points from worst to best regarding the behavior of that person.

Unmasking the truth has never been easier. Sign up today and become one of the millions of online users who will unmask the truth. Once you register, create a profile, upload a photo of the person you wish to unmask, and tell your story. We don’t use cookies to track user`s preferences; private information is never stored on our servers. 
If there’s an unreported crime that you’d like to report, support your evidence with video, audio, or text. If there’s a cause, crime, or offense you’d like to bring awareness to, send us any supporting documents you have – whether Word Doc, sound files, flash or mobile video, URL link, printout, clipping, press release – really, anything and everything that supports your claim. Once verified for authenticity through community voting, your story gets posted. So, what are you waiting for? Unmask the truth and let the world hear your voice! Allow the voice of truth to build a better tomorrow!
