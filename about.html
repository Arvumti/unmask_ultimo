        <p><strong>Technical Info</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:2em">Xavier Ares is the CEO and creator of the concept and idea of UNMASK™®. The website www.unmask.wiki, was developed in the city of Durango, Mexico; Re-designed by CELERART based in Ukraine and it Servers are located in Moscow, Russia. All rights for the brand, concept and logos are already in process for International Registry and Trade Mark by Marcaria.
</p>
        <p>UNMASK website is the first and only social network in its kind in all the world. It Goal is to helps People pull the Mask from anyone who has something to hide and expose it to the world without any fear to be punished as every post will be done completely anonymous. </p>
         <p>Most people realize by now that the images portrayed by people in their lives – friends, family, acquaintances, teachers, colleagues, etc. – are never quite the "truth." However, until now there's been no simple, safe way to warn others of dangerous or unsavory types lurking in plain sight. UNMASK gives its users that power; an anonymous and free platform, UNMASK is unique in the social network landscape. Its creators envision the site as a tool to help people protect themselves from harm before starting any kind of relationship with another person. Learn more at www.unmask.wiki or the site's YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYMuCrmpp86QG4eHb-vHqkQ. 
             
        </p>
        <p>The point of UNMASK is not just public shaming, it's about safety and security by exposing the truth about others. We believe liars, cheaters and criminals should be forced to show their 'true faces to the world, and now we have a platform and social network to do just that.
        </p>
        <p>No one wants to go to a church, job or school where someone in a leadership position has a sketchy past. If a sexual deviant has moved to your local neighborhood, don’t you deserve the right to know? What if that deviant has a child fetish? Can you imagine yourself tempting fate in leaving your young son or daughter within arm’s reach of an ex-con? What if a former politician, convicted of corruption, suddenly decides to enter the business world? Can you picture yourself hiring that person in a managerial role for your company? Or even worst, in a financial role, where they’d have free rein to loot, steal, and embezzle hard-earned funds? Perhaps your soon-to-be future fiancé has a secret past – a murder conviction – one or more domestic violence arrests – a history of alcohol abuse – drug trafficking – prostitution? While cloaked in a veil of secrecy, virtually anything is fair game? So, ask yourself this; would you really feel comfortable committing while still in the dark? Some may argue a right of privacy. We argue a right of protection. Unmask empowers users with the virtual tools they need to stay informed and warn others about the peoples behavior’s. 
</p>
        <p>In a person’s professional and personal life, there’s always a need to stay informed. They’re company memos, press releases, social media message boards, in-person and virtual meetings, news segments that we see on TV and online, newspaper and magazine articles that we read so often, and emails that we skim through each day. One way or another, electronic media has allowed the world community to stay connected to global and local events as they unfold. So, think of Unmask as being no different. We’re simply your eyes and ears, in an easy way keeping you with knowledge at all times.</p>
        <p>Unmask is committed to provide safe forum for global online users to share their story, anonymously, helping unmask fraud, crime, and truth, one tale at a time.
