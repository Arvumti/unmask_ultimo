       <h1>Virtual Social Life</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="texto_extra">
        <p>Whether a matter of Twitter, Facebook, Vkontakte, Instagram, Blogger, Ask, etc social media connects users with the world around them; of course, this is done purely through a virtual medium. If you’re an MTV junkie, or at the very least have become familiar with the terms “cat fishing” or “Te’oing” in the past decade, then, of course, you’re also aware of the hidden dangers involved in connecting with others through a purely virtual medium. After all, who’s to say that the social media profile you’ve connected with is actually the authentic verifiable identity of someone in the real world?</p>
         <p>Even that “she” could in fact be a he – that “he” could in fact be a she – from that “experienced” homegrown virtual worker from Fiverr, Guru, Upwork, or Freelancer could in fact be an inexperienced high school or primary school student, busily toiling away in a far off land; until the worst of all, those “friends” in your social media friends list may not be who they claim to be. Instead of young fellow peers, they could in fact be mature outside predators, lying in wait for just the right moment and just the right place to sink their fangs into you.
